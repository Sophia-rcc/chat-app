Hello!
My name is Sophia and I'm an exchange student from Germany.
In Germany my course of study is called "Media Management" and I'm doing a specialisation in Journalism and Digital Media. Digital Media in this case means web development. I'm at TAMK for one semester (great timing  doing an exchange semester during a pandemic, isn't it?) and I'm taking all courses of the Web and App Design and Development Minor.
I do enjoy web development and have some previous experience - I'd say I'm pretty good with HTML and CSS and I do alright with JavaScript and PHP. Anything more complicated than that like Java or any C language gives me quite some trouble though. I know the very basics of those, since I studied something else before, but I remember very little. I'm not entirely sure what to expect from this course, but I really hope I'll do alright and I'm definitely interested and willing to learn.
My other interests lie mostly in reading and writing, so the combination of Journalism and Digital Media in my specialisation is pretty perfect for me. Although I figured out, that I do not really enjoy journalistic writing. I'm more of a fiction writer and while I do have no illusions of becoming a writer, I do want to pursue writing in my free time.
I'm 24 so I guess I'm already pretty grown up, but I'm still not entirely sure what I want to do or be. Or rather I know what I would like to be, but I'm not sure I could actually make it. I would like to become a web developer, but I don't know if I'm good enough for that or what anyone would expect from a web developer. So still trying to figure that out.
Anyway, I'm very happy to be studying at TAMK and I'm very much looking forward to this course!
